        MOV  AX, DATAS
        MOV  DS, AX

        LEA  DX, STRING

   C:> edit file_name.asm
   ```

5. If you already have the assembly file, follow these steps:  
   - Copy your assembly file to the `C:\8086` folder.  
   - Run the following commands:  

     ```shell
     C:> masm your_file_here.asm
     C:> link your_file_here.obj
